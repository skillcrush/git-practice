            <h4>Don't give up!</h4>
            <p>Coding will be one of the hardest things you have ever learned, so remember that, and don't give up when
                it gets hard.</p>

            <h4><span>But</span> Take breaks.</h4>
            <p>When you feel like you are losing steam or starting to lose interest, you may be burned out, so take a
                break.
