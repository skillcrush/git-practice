                        <p class="content">You might think of programming as cooking and serving meals. It helps to plan your dishes and pace yourself through each component so that you can pull it off in a manageable manner.<br><br>And let's not forget who you're cooking for!</p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>When planning your meal, you should think about the balance of flavors you'll get from the ingredients you put in. Does anything distract from what you're trying to accomplish, or is something missing?<br><br>Then with some prep you'll have each component to add in the right order while building your dishes!</p>

                    <h3>Learn what you need, not just what you want!</h3>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p class="content">You may drool over the idea of spending all your time tweaking that perfect layout and color scheme you came up with, but you'll have to make sure you have the functions you need for your users and include them before overthinking what you want things to look like.<br><br>It's as much about how things work as how much they're enjoyed. You may not want to spend all your time on dessert, since a person needs some substance to get through things... Even professional bakers!</p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>You'll want to refresh your memory of metholologies from time to time, whether it's how to structure your css stylesheets or how to work with a team on Git, so that you don't overlook anything. Think of it as looking at your recipes!  And remember, if you get frustrated, take a break and remember what you want to get out of things.<br><br>A souffle takes great care, but they're not for everyone! Have fun and make what you want, as long as you keep pushing yourself outside your comfort zone (even if just a little)!</p>
