                <h4>Embrace the beginning</h4>
                <p>You're just starting on your journey, and once you've learned these skills, you'll never be a beginner again.
                    There's something really beautiful about knowing that, and I want you to embrace it. Ask questions. Find
                    ways to learn what you don't know. Get curious.
                </p>

                <h4>Mindset is key</h4>
                <p>By committing to this program, you are committing to a growth mindset. Frustration is expected when things go
                    awry. Take time to decompress if needed; then form a plan to overcome the obstacles ahead of you.  You will
                    improve quickly when you can take your failures, mistakes, and setbacks and use them as motivation to move
                    forward.
