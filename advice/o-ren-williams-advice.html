                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it has probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Believe in the Magic!!</h4>
                <p>If you truly believe in your heart of hearts that you want to be a developer, then believe in the magic of digital creation! More simply, think of yourself as a wizard of web design.</p> <p>Nope, nope, don't question it! Say it with me, "I am a wizard of web design and I am learning my craft." Say it again. Now one more time, but this time with...FEELING!</p>
                <p>Ahhhh! Didn't saying it feel good? Did it, at least, make you smile? If you truly are a web developer in the making, it has to feel good to say it and you may even BELIEVE IT to be true even if it is only for a nanosecond...before Ms. or Mr. Skepticism creeps back in. But that feelgood moment is real...and it can last longer than a nanosecond if you let it. You just have to rinse and repeat. That's the magic. Let yourself believe that you already are a developer, a programmer, a coder, the software engineer that you dream of being and after all of the hard work that you will be putting in to your coursework, one day, you'll look in the mirror and, LO...it will be so. Words have power. So just tell yourself the right ones. And keep on doing it...especially when the coding exercises and all of the debugging and the portfolio projects and the programming language syntax that you didn't know that you really didn't know!... all get tough. And they will. Just don't give up! YOU WILL LEARN and ACCOMPLISH and even BECOME REALLY GOOD --if not great!-- at all of those things...eventually.</p>
                <p>Just like the apprentice wizard who must first learn the basics and then PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, if you do the same, you'll discover that you, too, have been doing the MAGIC of</p>
