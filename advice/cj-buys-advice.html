                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Despite what you're told, no one is good at everything when they start out. There's always a learning
                    curve, where your brain is adjusting to all the new information. And confusion is a part of that!</p>

                <p>Confusion is your brain telling you that it's still figuring things out. It won't always be that way!
                    Think of it as a brand-new filing system - until you know where everything goes, it takes a little
                    time to find stuff. But, in no time, your brain will have made the connections you need and it'll
                    be second nature!</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>Part of the reason it feels so uncomfortable is because you're comparing where you are with coding
                    with where you are with other tasks, tasks where your brain already knows the filing system. Think
                    about how it feels to read code, versus how it feels to read regular text.</p>

                <p>But the thing is, reading regular text wasn't always second nature! At one point, it was hard, too,
                    and it took a lot of thought. What changed wasn't that reading itself got easier - you just got more
                    practice!</p>

                <p>So don't stress if reading code is hard right now! Just practice, and it'll all get easier with time!</p>
