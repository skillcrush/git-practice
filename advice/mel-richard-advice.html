                <h4>Consistency is key</h4>
                <p>When learning soemthing new, practice is everything and keeping a schedule is key. I have learned that taking
                  a small, well-deserved break, was much harder to come back from than expected! Since taking that break, I
                  decided to dedicate at least 15 minutes to work on a lesson or a part of a lesson everyday! With summer it is hard
                  to stay inside to learn to code, but a few 15 minutes here and there can make a big difference!
                </p>

                <h4>Trust the process!</h4>
                <p> Learning can be uncomfortable. I have decided to stop looking at job desriptions for a little while since
                  reading them tends to bring a "I can't do that, will I ever be able to do that?" uncertainty in my mind which
                  plays on motivation and "why am I even doing that?". So I choose to trust the process and believe that I am on the
                  right track!
