            <h1>Hi, my name is Greta and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Discipline is KEY!</h4>
                <p>It's motivating to start something new. But, the excitement of a new adventure soon loses its luster when its time to work hard. My advice to you is to KEEP GOING!</p>

                <ul> 
                    <li> Step one: create a routine that most excites you.</li>
                    <li> Step Two: Show up every day at that time to singularly focus on the task at hand.</li>
                    <li> Step Three: Seek wisdom with the resources available through the program like <a href= "skillcrush-student.slack.com"> Skillcrush Student Slack</a></li>
                    <li> Step four: Keep at it! Every day, even when you feel unmotivated, persist! Motivation will come in due time.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p> By following these steps, you will begin to develop belief in yourself. Great job!</p>

                <h4>Its simple, but not easy.</h4>
                <p>S When learning a new skill, always speak to yourself kindly. 
                    Develop your patience and curiosity when you encounter errors. 
                    Develop a healthy strategy for when you are feeling disregulated or upset. </p>

                <p>Thank goodness for the teachers of Skillcrush. 
                    They have made it simple for us to learn. However, that doesnt mean the road ahead is without difficulty. Keep a steady pace and a cool head.  </p>

                <p> Lastly, have fun, be creative and get going! You have the power to make it happen!</p>
