                <h4>Just Start.</h4>
                <p>Don't wait for the perfect moment to begin your new path - just start.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you need a sign, this is it. Put the money on the barrelhead and just go for it.</p>

                <h4>Tell someone.</h4>
                <p>Maybe it's your mom, maybe it's your best friend, or perhaps it's your dog. Just tell someone, anyone.
                If someone else knows you're working on a goal it just makes it that much easier to keep working.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Don't worry if it's not perfect.</h4>
                <p>You've got plenty of time to learn more and keep going.</p>
