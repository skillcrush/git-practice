            <h4>Build Mind Trails</h4>
            <p> Learning is exploring a place you've always wanted to go. I imagine Olympia National Forest
                in Washington State. I see new plants, hear new sounds, and I wonder what my next meal will be. I'm not scared 
                because I know I'm safe, and every time I visit the forest I know it a little more about it. I visit the forest 
                frequently, and I notice how it changes. Sometimes I use a map and sometimes I can remember the path.
            </p>

            <p> Your mind is the forest. The most-traveled paths are clear and wide. You easily pass, sometimes without looking,
                and you comfortably guide others. If you get lost you know your landmarks, and these parts of the forest become second 
                nature. When debris blocks your way you use resources to clear it. The forest has boundaries, but beyond the forest is the ocean.
             </p>

            <h4>Learning Happens in the Sticky Place </h4>
            <p> Don't shy away from the discomfort of the ocean. Push your boundaries and explore something new.
                You find your sea legs after weathering some storms. You appreciate the storms because they bring freshwater aboard,
                and you appreciate your mates for not letting you go overboard. You never get used to the rocking of the ship and 
                the relentless salty waves. You see land, and you're grateful for the journey but you're glad it's over for now. 
            </p>

            <p> People ask where you've been, and what you're doing now. You tell them what you've learned and you continue along
                your mind paths. Next time you reach the ocean you remember the last time, and although you feel the sinosoidal dread it brings
                you have every indication that your voyage will be a successful one. Go get 'em, sailor!
