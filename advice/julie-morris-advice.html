                <h4>One Step At A Time</h4>
                <p>Take each day, each lesson, as its own individual problem to solve. There is so much to learn (and you'll likely never stop learning), so try not to get bogged down with what you don't know and simply add to what you do know.</p>

                <h4>Let Go of Perfection</h4>
                <p>You'll probably move through some concepts quickly, often before you feel like you "mastered" them. But many concepts layer on one another, so you may find that when you come back to elements you thought were confusing at a  later date, they suddenly become much more clear! Don't feel like you have to get each step "perfect" before moving on.
