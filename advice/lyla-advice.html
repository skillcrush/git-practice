            <h2 class="top">Confusion is your friend!</h2>
            <p>When you start programming, you are doing something that you have never done before. It's similar to
                learning a new language. It's a challenge, and takes time to learn all the rules and vocabulary.</p>

            <p>Confusion is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h2>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h2>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                This is a normal part of the process.
            </p>
            <h2>Practice!</h2>
            <p class="bottom">Like learning an instrument, there are millions of ways to combine the individual notes that ultimately
                result in different pieces of music, just as there millions of ways to combine code to achieve different
                outcomes. Like any other new language, the more you understand the individual parts, the more
                things you can put together. The more you practice, the easier it gets. Trust the process,
                and happy coding!</p>
