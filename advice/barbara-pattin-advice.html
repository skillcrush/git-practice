                <h4>Comparing yourself to others is a waste of time</h4>
                <p>Just don't. Stay focused on your goals, your accomplishments and why you want to learn to code.  Keep a journal as a reminder of how far you've come.</p>
 
                <p>If you're having a tough day, step away. Take a walk, call a friend. Do something that makes you happy and then come back with fresh eyes.</p>
 
                <h4>Find your tribe</h4>
                <p>Surround yourself with positive people and a supportive community.  There's always someone out there who can help and wants to. </p>
                
                <p>Remember to thank those who offer answers. Don't forget to give back generously to the group when you're further along your path.</p>
 
                <p>Listen to podcasts, watch videos, and read about how others have learned to code for inspiration. Follow, like and share resources you find.</p>
 
                <h4>You don't need to know "all the things"...</h4>
                
                <p>if you know where to find the answers and how to search!  Learn and apply new skills as you go.</p>
                
                <p> Be confident that you'll find the solution.  Don't be embarassed to call on your tribe and ask for help.</p>
                
                <p>Keep showing up and working at it. </p>
