                <h4>Believe in yourself!</h4>
                <p>The first thing to do is believe that you deserve to be here, learning something new, taking on a fantastic
                    challenge, and opening up a whole world of new opportunities! It may seem overwhelming at times, especially when
                    previewing each new task ahead, but you have been given the tools that it takes to complete the task and impress yourself every time.</p>

                
                <h4>Trust the process.</h4>
                <p>As you go through the process of learning something new, you may not be able to see how it all comes together, or how it will
                    work in the real world...that's okay! Trust that you are on track to make the changes to your life and career that taking these steps
                    are preparing you for.</p>

                <p>As you move deeper into this new language, you are learning what it takes to break into tech. Do the work, learn the steps and visualize 
                    your success. You've GOT this!</p>
