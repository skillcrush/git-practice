                <h4>Just keep coding!</h4>
                <p>Learning to code is going to be exciting and scary, just like learning anything! A new language, a new instrument, a new cooking technique, a new sport... you've learned so many things in your life
                    and you can learn this too! I know that we've subconsciously
                    accepted the idea that there are "tech" people and "non-tech" people in the world, but screw that! If someone else can learn it, then you can learn it too. Think of all the other
                    new things you've learned in your life! Coding is just another thing that you can totally do. So just take it one step at a time and don't give up!
                </p>

                <h4>Use all your resources!</h4>
                <p>You have so many resources at your fingertips! Use the Slack community, your instructors, the live Q&A sessions, and, ya know, the Internet, to get your questions answered.
                    You don't have to reinvent the wheel or do it all yourself! Professional coders use their resources all the time too; having a question or problem just means you're DOING this, for real.
                </p>
                <h4>Go get it!!</h4>
