            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>

            <h4>Don't be afraid of mistakes.</h4>
            <p>It's natural to want to avoid making mistakes and the situations where we might feel self-criticism or
                shame
                when we do make a mistake. But this fear and avoidance will only deprive us of the opportunity to grow
                and learn.</p>
            <p>You will make mistakes. Don't let this deter you, instead embrace it. Try new things, mess up, this is
                the best way to learn
                and grow.</p>
            <p>Now, get out there and make some mistakes!</p>
