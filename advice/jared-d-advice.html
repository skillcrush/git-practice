                <h4>Patience is the greatest virtue!</h4>
                <p>When you start anything new and frustration kicks in, <br>just take a breath, relax and remember
                    that
                    patience is a virtue.</p>

                <p>You are more likely to solve a mentally taxing problem when you are in a relaxed frame of mind,
                    <br>not a
                    stressed and panicked state.</p>

                <h4>Let those critical thoughts or doubts be.</h4>
                <p>Most of us, if not all of us get them and they are normal. The problems come when we listen to them
                    or buy into them. <br>Don't bother trying to combat them, just let them be there and continue on.
                </p>
                <h4>Relative paths work better here!</h4>
