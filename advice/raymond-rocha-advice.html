                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Confusion is hated by many people such as myself when I'm in a state of confusion I tend to shut down and give up but in this case, I have come to terms with confusion it has helped me significantly to understand new things that I am learning and I love it. It encourages me to find out what is confusing me and along the way, I find new learning material some things that I didnâ€™t know that could be done in a class such as this it is very confusing if you do not know any of it and starting fresh my advice is that confusion is your friend it should encourage you to learn more about the topic that is confusing to your knowledge is power.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
