                <h4>Sometimes stepping back is actually a step forward</h4>
                <p>I sometimes grapple with impatience when I am trying to learn a new thing.  
                    I have learned that my first pass at learning a new skill is an "exposure" 
                    experience where I fill my brain with new terms and ideas and process.</p>

                <p>Then I need to step back and let the new information settle in my brain and come back to it for a second pass.
                    The second pass can be an "enrichment" experience where I am able to deepen my understanding because everything isn't so new to me.
                    And then I take a break to let that information settle into my brain and repat until I have an "integration" experience 
                    when I feel "at home" with the new material and can feel more comfortable experimenting because every step doesn't feel so daunting.</p>
                
                <p>So don't be afraid to take a moment instead of just muscling through.  That moment might be where your breakthoughs happen</p>
