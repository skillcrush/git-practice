  <h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span
      class="s2"><b>Confusion is your friend!</b></span></h4>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s2">When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have
      never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so
      specific that it's probably never been done before.</span></p>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s2">Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a
      signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
      to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</span></p>
  <h4 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 16.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Times; color: #000000; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span
      class="s2"><b>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</b></span></h4>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s2">When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first
      programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
      the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.<span
        class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s2">This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a
      critical part of the process.</span></p>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s2">You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process
      includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
      totally understand what it's doing.</span></p>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s2">Also, I would recommend that you are constant every time you start to study try to
      practice at least two hours a day. I will also recommend that you have a clear path on what you want to accomplish
      after each lesson and after the full course, asking those questions is what is going to keep you moving forward
      and motivated through times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s2">For example, if you have a job that you don't like and you're not really learning
      anything new and not having enough money to pay your bills, it can serve you as a motivation to keep moving
      forward and have a better job.</span></p>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s2">If you know you're smart, hard-worker and persistent go out and look what you deserve,
      never stand still my friend! You were created for something bigger, to create a legacy!</span></p>
  <p class="p4"><span class="s2">Kisses,</span></p>
