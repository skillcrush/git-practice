                <h2>Confusion is Your friend and Mine!</h2>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a NEW challenge, a New opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that You are heading in the RIGHT direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="advice">
                <h2>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h2>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                   <!-- Famous quotes found online about not giving up. -->
                   <h3>Remember great people get stuck and have challenges too, and they never give/gave up.</h3>
                   <p>"If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it."<br><em>Michael Jordan</em></p>

                   <p>"Success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm."<br><em>Abraham Lincoln</em></p>

                   <p>"To bring about change, you must not be afraid to take the <strong>first step. We will fail when we fail to try.</strong>"<br><em>Rosa Parks</em></p>

                   <p>So hang in there, times may feel tough, but you can do it!  Give yourself credit for making it this far, look forward, know others have completed this course and gained great benefits from it.  You can too!  Now get coding!  :-)</p>
