                <h4>Confusion isn't your enemy! Google is your BFF!</h4>
                <p>When starting out on a new development project, it can be easy to get overwhelmed and feel like there's
                  no way you can figure it out, but I'm here to tell you that you've got this! Even though it can be scary,
                  you can figure it out. Chances are, someone in the world has faced a similar problem.</p>

                <p>Starting with Googling your problem can help you connect with people who have worked through similar
                  issues in the past. Forums like Stack Overflow have pages and pages of advice, community problem solving,
                  and more. Google won't solve your problems for you, but it can point you in the direction of
                  resources that will give you the tools to solve them yourself.</p>

                <h4>Sometimes sitting in the confusion can get you far.</h4>
                <p>The fact of the matter is that when you're learning a new technology, you won't know how to use it right
                  off the bat. That's normal and okay!</p>

                <p>When you sit in the confusion and problem solve your way through it, you learn <em>so much more</em> than
                  you do if someone leads you through it immediately. That doesn't mean you shouldn't get help, but it does
                  mean that it's usually worth it to at least <em>try</em> to solve the problem on your own before getting
                  someone to show you the answer.</p>

                <p>Lean on the resources you have to lead you through the confusion, but don't be afraid to try things out!
                  As long as you take a backup first, usually there's not much damage that can't be undone. So get out
                  there and get your hands dirty!</p>
