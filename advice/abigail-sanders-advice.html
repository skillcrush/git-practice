            <h4>Just Do Your Best!</h4>
            <p>When you start learning how to code, it seems like you're learning a new language. That's because you
                are! Don't expect to fully understand everything on the first pass. Just do your best to understand core
                concepts. Don't be afraid to go through a course more than once if you need to!</p>

            <h4>Stay Consistent</h4>
            <p>One of the best things you can do while learning how to code is to stay consistent. If you go weeks
                between lessons, you'll lose interest and your skills won't remain as sharp. When you do something
                consistently and show up for yourself, your ability to learn and grasp new concepts expands. Your brain
                and skills stay flexibile and it's much easier to continue learning new things!
            </p>

            <h4>Be Patient</h4>
            <p>Don't beat yourself up. Think of the type of teacher you'd want and be that for yourself. Kind, gentle,
                forgiving, and encouraging. If you don't get something the first time, that's okay! Keep working at it.
                Looking up resources outside of Skillcrush or using other tools in your toolbelt (like your instructors
                and classmates) is a great resource.</p>
