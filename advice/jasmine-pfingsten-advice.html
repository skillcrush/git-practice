                <h4>Don't get ahead of yourself.</h4>
                <p>When we first start learning a new skill, it's easy to push ourselves a little too hard -- impressing
                   others, or maybe trying to impress ourselves -- and in doing so, we ultimately overwhelm ourselves with new material.
                   It's important to remember that you can only take in so much new information at once, and your brain needs time to
                   process that information. Check in with yourself and make sure you're going at a pace that allows you to really absorb
                   new concepts.</p>

                <h4>Failure is a teacher.</h4>
                <p>No matter how well you take to a new skill like coding, you will inevitably run up against a mistake, an error,
                   or a problem you don't know how to fix. This is part of every student's learning process, so if failure is
                   disappointing for you, try to reframe it. Failure is not an indicator of your skill; it is an opportunity
                   to deepen or refine your skill. Somewhere in the mistake that's been made is something you're being asked to
                   learn. Go find that thing. Think of it like a scavenger hunt, and reward yourself when you find the answer.
                </p>

                <h4>Make sure you're having fun.</h4>
                <p>Learning is definitely work, but the material should engage you and hold your interest. If something about what
                   you're doing isn't fun for you, don't be afraid to have an honest check-in with yourself and ask whether or not
                   this is the right challenge for you right now. If the material does excite you, but the experience is just
                   harder than you expected and you're struggling with that, know that the problem isn't whether or not you've got
                   what it takes to be a coder -- you do! But now would be a good opportunity to sit down with where you're at
                   emotionally and psychologically and see if the feeling of struggle might be coming from there instead of from
                   the course material. Talk through it with friends and get advice from fellow students. You can make it through!
