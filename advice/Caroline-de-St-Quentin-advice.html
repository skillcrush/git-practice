            <h1>Hi, my name is Caroline and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Practical advice that work for me</h4>
		
		<ul> 
			<li>Do a little bit every day!</li>

                	<li>Plan your study sessions if you have a busy schedule.</li>

                	<li>Take some breaks! You need to get your brain time to process all the new info</li>

			<li> Don't beat yourself up if you miss some sessions or have a few days off </li>

			<li>Don't give up! It will get clearer with practice and time.</li>
		</ul>
