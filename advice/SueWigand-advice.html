                <h4>Fear and Anxiety are <strong>NORMAL</strong>!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning to code, you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and it can be very scary.</p>

                <p>But you can do this! Look around, there are hundreds or even thousands of people in Skillcrush and on Slack that are [or were] in exactly the same place you are. They would all tell you it is so worth pushing through your fear and anxiety.
                </p>

                <p>Don't listen to those naysayers or even the voice inside that is telling you lies like "you can't do this." Every time you have faced something hard and accomplished it, you have faced down those lies. You are strong- you are capable! <strong>YOU CAN DO THIS!</strong></p>

                <h4>Use your resources!</h4>
                <p>Listen, I get it. No one likes to feel unsure. We've been conditioned out there in "adulthood" to never show that you are lost or confused. FORGET THAT!! The Slack channels are there to help! Everyone on the Slack channel, every SINGLE one, was a beginner once upon a time! They know what you're going through! Ask those questions!</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, or any new skill. Find a few buddies that are in your same class to bounce ideas off of. Ask the instructors questions. Go to the class channel and read a few posts. Get involved in your learning. Ask those questions. Join the Q&A sessions. Watch the webinars.</p>

                <p>You see, <em>YOU</em> are in charge of your learning coding. You are pursuing a better career for yourself. It's not always going to be easy to do. You might mess up and have to restart a class [or two]. But just think- in a few months, you'll know some of the answers on those Slack channels. You'll be able to help others! And a littel later, you'll be ready for YOUR OWN career in tech!</p>

                <p><strong>I BELIEVE IN YOU!</strong>I'm glad you chose to join Skillcrush! It's a wonderful, supportive place! I can't wait to meet you on Slack.</p>
