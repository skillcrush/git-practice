            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                totally understand what it's doing.</p>

            <h4>Trust in your ability to learn and grow.</h4>
            <p>When learning something for the first time, it is sometimes hard to imagine a future you who can do that
                particular skill with ease. One way of getting around this is understanding the difference between a
                fixed and a growth mindset.</p>

            <p>People with a fixed mindset believe that a person's intelligence and natural abilities are fixed and
                unchanging. Challenges and
                failures are a threat to their self-image, and there is a belief that having to work hard at something
                means that they lack the inherent talent to ever be truly successful at it.</p>

            <p>Conversely, those with a growth mindset believe that intelligence and abilities can be cultivated through
                persistent effort. Challenges and failures are therefore embraced as essential opportunities for growth
                and development. This makes them more likely to persevere in the face of setbacks, as obstacles are seen
                as natural parts of the learning process.</p>

            <p>If you're struggling with difficult coding skills, it's therefore important to embrace your failures, and
                to reframe them as a sign that you're stretching yourself in exciting new directions. By cultivating and
                maintaining a growth mindset, you will be amazed at what you can achieve.</p>
