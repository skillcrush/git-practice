                    <h3>Dissonance Shrouds the Path</h3>
                    <p>When your journey brings you something new, you stand on the precipice of unprecedented adventure. 
                        To open eyes, every moment can reveal a new challenge, a new opportunity, the promise of elation. 
                        But, when you explore the unknown, you will face the dark depths of ignorance.
                        Darkness breeds dissonance.</p>

                    <p>Dissonance, therefore, is a sign that you are moving toward growth. It's a signal that you
                        have engaged in the process of transformation and that it's time for you
                        to invest in yourself and persist, because Clarity awaits.</p>
                </article>
                <article id="belief">
                    <h3>Believing in yourself is possible</h3>
                    <p>When you are exploring thought, whether that's expressed as learning to code, discovering love, or
                        entertaining any facet of the infinite spectrum, doubt, fear, anxiety, frustration, anger, confusion, 
                        or any other word you would give Dissonance makes itself known. It feels inevitable and undeniable.
                    </p>

                    <p>I hope you find solace in knowing that the Dissonance is a commonly shared experience. In fact, to the 
                        degree that universal truth exists, it is believed to be crucial to growth. Do not resonate with the 
                        thought that Dissonance is omnipotent; you have power over it.

                <p>When you encounter something new, developing your understanding will help you overcome 
                    Dissonance.<br>You are not wrong for experiencing it, and you have the power to illuminate it.<br>Though the Path
                    is shrouded in Dissonance, Clarity awaits they who persist.
