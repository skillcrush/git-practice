                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before.
                  It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific
                  that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                  have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to
                  dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language,
                  or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are
                  looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to
                  train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand
                  what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Just keep trying! Don't give up!</h4>
                <p>Sometimes it gets frustrating when you get stuck on some activities, and you don't know what to do.
                  It usually happens to everyone. You're not alone! So you need to step out, get yourself a stretch, take a
                  break, grab a cup of coffee, and keep on trying the next day and you will get it eventually! It will take
                  a lot of practice before you can get used to it. So don't give up! Ask help when you need it!
