                <h4>You're going to stink.</h4>
                <p>That's right! Take a deep breath and say to yourself "I'm going to be bad at this...and then I will get better!".</p>

                <p>Embrace the "newness" of your place in the adventure.  You will never again be where you are right now, at the beginning. Being a beginner means you will stumble, you will learn and you will get back up and try again. Each time you try, you will get better and better! So, embrace being terrible at first! It's totaly ok and you will improve with each try.</p>

                <h4>Touch on your new skill everyday</h4>
                <p>It is so valuable to keep the memory of what you are learning fresh. Look at it, review it and practice it everyday. It keeps you on track. Unable to practice? Grab articles, listen to podcasts or talk to someone about what you are learning.
