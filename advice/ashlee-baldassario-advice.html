                <h4>Practice, Practice, Practice!</h4>
                <p>Like any new skill, programming and coding take practice. From what I have learned so far, the practice 
                    never ends, even when you are a certified coding <em>guru</em>! There will also always be new tricks and languages as technology
                    advances.</p>
                    
                <p>I like to compare it to yoga. There is always something to improve upon or learn and the continual practice
                     is part of the journey.</p>

                <h4>Making mistakes happens to everyone.</h4>
                <p>There will be mistakes, no questions asked. No matter how versed you are in a language or program, something as simple as
                    a typo can create turmoil within the project. Do not fret! Work with your team, coworkers, Skillcrushers alum and Github 
                    community to help you verify the errors.</p>
                    
                <p>There is endless support out there and all at the press of a button. 
                </p>
