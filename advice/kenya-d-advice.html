                <h4>Just Start!</h4>
                <p>Sometimes when you start something new, you want to make sure everything is perfect. You may want to 
                    wait for the stars to align or a lightbulb to switch to indicate that you understand everything. Truth 
                    is, learning is not linear, some days things may make sense more than others.</p>

                <p>Don't let the ebbs & flows discourage you. Failure and missteps are a natural part of learning. Honestly, 
                    if you are making mistakes that means you have the courage to just go for it! Remember: You don't have 
                    to be awesome to start but you have to start to be awesome.</p>

                <h4>Don't Put Pressure On Yourself</h4>
                <p>It's natural to put expectations on yourself when you're learning something new. You are excited at the 
                    prospect of where the success could lead you. As amazing as this is, it can be pretty counterproductive.</p>

                <p>It's important to find the balance between having an end goal & enjoying the journey of learning.</p>

                <p>You see, we were programmed at a young age to blindly sprint from one goal to the next as if to jump from 
                    one mountain to another. Somewhere along the way, we lost the enjoyment that comes with learning something 
                    new. Coding is a whole new world, you're not supposed to know everything right away. The important thing is, 
                    you took the first step & you're doing great. So whatever you do, just keep going!!</p>
