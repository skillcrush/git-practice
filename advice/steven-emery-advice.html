            <h4>Look ahead</h4>
            <p>Whatever coding you are learning now, even if it looks hazy and fuzzy, persevere as it'll become clearer
                in the long term.</p>

            <p>It is normal to feel overwhelmed, confused, impatient, but give it time and you'll get those 'ah'
                moments.</p>

            <h4>Persevere</h4>
            <p>Don't give up! Review the code, look for comma's, full points, capital letters, sometimes it's just a
                typo!
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                of the process.</p>

            <p>Take breaks, take a look through other learning resources, or go back and start at scratch with a project
                or code you are working with! In the long run everything clicks, so don't give up!</p>
