                <p>You came across struggles learning how to balance on your bike in the early years of life.<br>
                This is no difference. It is all about "new".<br>
                You feel unsafe of something new, that's <em>natural</em>.<br>
                You feel frustrated after failures, that's <em>natural</em>.<br>
                You feel downhearted after multi-failures, that's <em>natural</em>.
                But my friend, it's like you hurted yourself multiple times before you could ride your bike like a racer.
                <br><br>
                When you can feel the nature of this learning, I hope you can step up again and try more, because it's worth. Don't compare your begin to someone's middle.
                <br><br>
                And one more thing, making mistakes is a <em>natural</em> part of learning.
                <br><br>
                It doesn't matter if you fail, it matters if you give up.
                <br><br>
                And it will be so wonderful to be a pro after everything you've put into it. You look great!
                <br><br>
                You got this, fella!</p>
