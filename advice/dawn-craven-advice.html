        <h1>Hi, my name is Dawn Craven and I have some advice for you!</h1>

        <div class="advice">
            <h4>If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!</h4>
            <p>It may sound cliche, but it's great advice. Don't give up on yourself, keep moving forward. Nothing you
                ever learned was gained in one day. It took failing before you got it. This will take time, effort, hard
                work, blood, sweat, tears. It Will get easier and WILL be worth it. Never give up, never surrender!</p>

            <h4>Invest in your future.</h4>
            <p>Buy some books on the subjects you're learning. Besides having all the resource documents you'll have as
                you go through your classes this is a great way to add to your wealth of knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>Having an extensive library of additional resources to pull from is great when getting stuck.</p>

            <p>Books for beginners, visual quick starts, even some of the one that have been written for kids learning
                to code have all been an asset to learning and moving passed some stuck moments.</p>
