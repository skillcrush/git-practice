            <h1>Hi, my name is Jeremiah and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>Just Keep Going!</h4>
                <p>When you start coding classes as a career change it can be overwhelming at first. The new languages and new computer programs you'll download are all confusing.
                    Just keep moving forward. Keep reading and repeating the exercises as many times as it takes.
                </p>

                <p>In time we will all learn the necessary skills to succeed in this endeavor. Some of us will learn quicker than others but we will all arrive at the same destination.
                    Freedom from the mundane jobs we may all be coming from.
                </p>

                <h4>Keep Your Head Up.</h4>
                <p>It is easy to become discouraged by the new languages and processes especially if your'e coming over from a non-tech career.
                    Just keep your head up and keep pushing. It's like sculpting a statue, just chipping away day after day until you have your David.
                </p>

                <p>Stop and stare at code, even if you don't fully understand what you're looking at. Open up the source code of whatever your favorite sites are. 
                    I often find myself staring at the ESPN source code trying to find things that I know and create the framework in my mind. Train your memory to recognize tags and css terms so that soon you'll be a coding rockstar.
