            <h4>Patience is a virtue.</h4>
            <p>That is an old saying but it is repeated so often because it is true.</p>

            <p>It definitely applies when you are first learning to code. You have to take your time so you can absorb
                all the information.</p>

            <h4>Write things down.</h4>
            <p>When learning something new, it often helps to write things down on paper. That can help you remember and
                you can also refer back to it when you need to.</p>

            <h4>Be kind to yourself.</h4>
            <p>Don't beat yourself up when you make mistakes as they're bound to happen.</p>

            <p>It isn't fun but it is part of the learning process and will make you better in the long rum.</p>

            <p>If you get frustrated, take a break. Maybe go for a walk, make a cup of coffee or tea or listen to your
                favorite podcast. When you return, your mind will be refreshed and you can dive back in with a new
                attitude.</p>
