                <h4>It is OK to feel confused!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new language, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>It is very normal to feel confused and sometimes discouraged, as you won't understand this whole programming world at first, but the more time you spend with it, the more things will start to make sense, at least thats what I have to keep telling myself everyday, specially when frustration comes around!</p>

                <h4>Don't overthink!</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening. Like with a new language, you will learn by trial and error. When you first start to "speak" this new language, don't expect to be an expert at first, it is OK to make mistakes.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
