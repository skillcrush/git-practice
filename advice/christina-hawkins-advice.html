                <h4>Get Comfortable with the Uncomfortable</h4>
                <p>Whether you're learning a new hobbie, picking up a long-past interest, or developing an entirely new
                  skill like coding - You are bound to feel uncomfortable. This discomfort is all a part of newness - Keep going!</p>

                  <h4> Get Messy <h4>
                <p>Don't be afraid of making mistakes, of troubleshooting on your own, or researching more information outside
                of your class resources. The sooner, and more often, you stand on your own feet the better you will be while working
              on your own or as a part of a team. </p>

                <h4>Get Bold</h4>
                <p>Lastly, loose all fear of asking for help. Beyond all of the resources at your disposal, your fellow coders are a
                wealth of knowledge and are incredibly helpful. Find a coding community on twitter, facebook, and other of your favorite
              social networks. You'll be suprised how many are out there and are willing to through out ideas when you're stuck!</p>
