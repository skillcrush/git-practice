        <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
        before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
        so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
      
        <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
        have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
        to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

        <h2 class="entry-title">Suspended disbelief!</h2>
          <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
          language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
          the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.

        <h3 class="widget-title">You Are Fine!</h3>
          <p>Being confused is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
          of the process.
