                <h4>Keep Going!</h4>
                <p>You know more now than you did at Lesson 1, Step 1. Keep pushing, reminding yourself of your goals and your "why" for starting. Don't look for motivation. Instead, excercise your discipline and choose to do the work. Remember, there are many other Skillcrushers working right along you and you have many resources between the cheatsheets, instructors, and Slack to get any help you need.</p>


                <h4>Trust the Process. Take the Advice.</h4>
                <p> I don't mean just the advice you're reading here. Experts developed the curriculum and have experienced knowledge of the industry. Everything is outlined for you with intent. Be patient with yourself. Take pride in what you're learning and applying.  You are well on your way!
