            <h4>Be Curious</h4>
            <p>Being curious while learning something new like coding will deepen your understanding throughout your
                Skillcrush classes. Follow those instructions in front of you because surely they have been carefully
                planned for you. Be curious to ask yourself why that code or command works, but don't dwell on it too
                long because your answer will arrive soon enough.</p>

            <h4>There is more than one way to code</h4>
            <p>This is true! I learned this along the way. How, you ask? I was curious enough to experiment during my
                lessons. However, be humble when your way is not the right way and learn from your mistakes. You will be
                full of wisdom on this journey.
            </p>

            <h4>Find Your Pace</h4>
            <p>Everyone has a different learning pace so find yours and stick with it.</p>
