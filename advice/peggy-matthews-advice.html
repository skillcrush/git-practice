                <h2>Confidence</h2>
                <p>Definition: a feeling of self-assurance arising from one's appreciation of one's own abilities or qualities.</p>

                <p>Everytime you complete a lesson you will build on the confidence that you should have coming into these courses
                     in Skillcrush. Do not let anything bring you down. You have plenty of support from both the instructors at Skillcrush, along with other students.</p>

                <h2>Mistakes</h2>
                <p>Of course you will make mistakes. Anytime we learn something completely new, we are going to make errors along
                     the way. But these will all shape your understanding as you continue on your journey through each lesson in a course. This
                      is normal so stick with it and do not become discouraged.</p>

                <h2>Do NOT Giveup</h2>
                <p>Whatever you do, don't give up. You can do this! If you have a hard time understanding something, walk away from it
                     for a while. Sometimes just taking a break then coming back to it can really help.</p>
