                <h4>"Slow and Steady Wins the Race"</h4>
                <p>It's important to consistently engage with Skillcrush coursework or other tech education materials on a daily basis to keep up your momentum. There will of course be days when you don't have the cognitive energy to go through a lesson. Instead of skipping a day, take time to listen to a podcast, or read an article, or watch a YT video related to something that you're learning. Even if you only have 20min to work with, it's worth it to do SOMETHING. All the bits of knowledge you accumulate from here and there add up over time.</p>

                <h4>Take Notes</h4>
                <p>Even though Skillcrush spells everything out for you on the site, it's still important to take notes. Notetaking helps with retention, and is a good way to check whether you have a good grasp of the concepts. Rather than using pen and paper, a notetaking app is a great tool because it's searchable, and you don't have to worry about crappy handwriting!
