                <h4>It's OK to make mistakes!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new world where you will be able to make a change, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before. Exciting, isn't it?</p>

                <p>Mistakes are expected. It's a sign that you are heading in the right direction.
                    That you are willing to take on the challenge of learning a new language...Computer language that is. As with learning
                    any new language, it means learning a new way of thinking. So it takes time and humility.
                    Learn to have a sense of humor with yourself, once you can deal with mistakes you
                    are more likely to succeed and go deeper as things become clearer and clearer.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening. 
                    You might also, get discouraged if others are advancing faster than you.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing. Also beneficial, is to set small goals for yourself.
                    And when you reach them, give yourself a small reward! This will help to keep you 
                    motivated! &#127947;</p>
