                <h4>Bite it off in small chunks!</h4>
                <p>As a beginner to coding, you may feel completely overwhelmed by the barrage of information. That's normal! Just take it one lesson at a time, one language 
                    at a time. Stack new knowledge on the one you just learned in bits and pieces. Like a quilt, it takes time to form the full picture but it will eventually come 
                    together and make sense!
                </p>
 
                <h4>Fake it till you make it!</h4>
                <p>One thing that's helped me keep going amidst doubts that I can ever know all there is to know to be good at coding is embracing 
                   the uncertainty by knowing that I'm already learning so much. You feel like an imposter- like a fake-coder. But try pretending your 
                   future self already knows everything you're setting out to learn and the current you is just walking toward that future. You get 
                   there by doing, and doing it over and over. Just keep doing! Like riding a bike, with practice, you'll get it!
                </p>
 
                <p>Open up your beginner's eye and notice everything in the coding language you're learning. By simply paying close attention, you 
                    will seep up so much knowledge and get familar with the ins and outs of it. Keep going and keep knowing you're going to make it!
