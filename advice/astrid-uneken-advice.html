                <h4>Be kind to yourself</h4>
                <p>Learning something new can be confusing and challenging. You are going to make mistakes and do things wrong,
                    and that can be very frustrating. However, being confused and making mistakes is all part of the learning process!
                    So have patience and most importantly, be kind to yourself and allow yourself to make mistakes.</p>

                <h4>Take care of yourself</h4>
                <p>If you are enjoying learning how to code, it can be easy to get swept up in it and sit at your computer for hours,
                    so make sure you take a few breaks! Walk around the room, get something to eat and drink enough water. Your 
                    body and mind will thank you!</p>

                <h4>Find some friends</h4>
                <p>Learning with other people is always more fun, and can be very helpful when you're having trouble with 
                    something or need some accountability. So get in touch with other people in the course, it really makes 
                    the experience a lot more fun and engaging! Plus, it is a good opportunity for some networking too!</p>
