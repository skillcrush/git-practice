                <h4>Cubs are curious and often stick their noses in bees nests.</h4>
                <p>Ever looked at a string of code and asked yourself: "What is this?" Glyphs? A secret message? Something you can eat?<br>
                    The curious cub stretches a pow and poke at it, changes a word here, add braces there, forget some slashes and angle brackets.<br>
                    In three words: makes a mess. Don't panic! That is how you learn to code: try, try and try again.<br> Practice until you become a roaring lion coder!</p>

                <p>The more code you read and write, the more familiar it becomes. Suddenly, all the bees-code flying around aimlessly become a neat aerobatic team. And you, cub-coder, are the one choreographing it. <br>Everything is clear and make sense. When you see a fancy button on a web page, the corresponding code string will pop up in your mind like a second thought. <br>Go cub-coder: discover and practice!</p>

                <h4>Even cubs need to learn to talk.</h4>
                <p>Coding is talking to the computer. If you want the computer to understand you and do what you tell it, you need to learn its language.<br>
                    As every cub, you start with elementary words and expressions, adding intricate ways to deliver your messages as you grow and learn.<br>
                    Master the language and, you can make your website dance!
                </p>

                <p>When you learn a new language, it seems you will never be able to learn and remember all the words. You try, but the sentences don't come right. Grammar is a nightmare.<br> Do not despair! Concentrate on the basics first, even if it doesn't make much sense, and add to your vocabulary as you go.<br> Time to have a "chat" with your text editor, cub-coder!</p>
