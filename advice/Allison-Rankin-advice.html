            <h4>Setting Aside Time</h4>
            <p>It is important to have a schedualed time to sit down and work. Even though this is self paced, look at
                it as if you are taking online classes through a University. It should hold the same importance. I tell
                friends that I cannot do anything at a certain time because I am taking my online classes.</p>

            <h4>Learn To Explain Your Thinking</h4>
            <p> Being able to explain your thinking while coding is important for your future career. Employers want to
                understand your why you are making the decisions you are making. Being able to explain your thinking
                will also help you be able to communicate with you team when there is confusion or issues with the code.
            </p>

            <h4>When You Get Stuck</h4>
            <p>First, check for typos. If there are no typos, check your notes to make sure your code is correct. If you
                are still having trouple ask someone for help. Make sure you tell them what you have already done to try
                to fix the issue.</p>
