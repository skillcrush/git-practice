            <h3>Hey Internet Cuz,</h3>

            <p>Are you scared right now? <em>I get it!</em> Your fear is not undounded. $2000 bucks for a program that
                will teach you the skills for a new career that offers higher pay and flexibiltiy?!? Well, believe it
                honey!<br>
                We both are learning these skills so we can improve our financial situation---and heal some
                intergenerational traumas along the way! Just know on the slick side, you are taking up room
                thus making not only the tech space but the world more inclusive and diverse.😁<br>
                Even Bey said, "Not enough Black women had a seat at the table, so I had to chop down that wood and build
                my
                own table. Then I had to invite the best there was to have a seat. That meant hiring women, men,
                outsiders, underdogs. And I've been very proud
                to provide them with a place at my table."</p>

            <h3>If You Want My Advice...</h3>
            <h4>Be Gentle With Yourself</h4>
            <p>Groundbreaking, I know. Honey, you are learning to read, write, and problem-solve in a new language all
                in 6 months. Give yourself a break! You are going to get this, I promise. <em>How do I know?</em>
                Because just last month, you were learning about HTML & CSS. You thought you would never get it. Look at
                you now.
                Learnin about the CLI and stuff...💅🏿</p>


            <h4>Just Walk Away</h4>
            <p>Not from the program, nah fam, we done already spent too much money!! I mean if you are stuck trying
                to
                figure out a problem: post the question in Slack, close the laptop, and go walk the fur baby. We
                both
                know that their head is getting heavy in your lap.🐶 I know you wanna grind it out but trust me, just
                walk
                away. The solution will be there in the morning.
            </p>

            <h4>Your Community Is Out There</h4>
            <p>You are not alone. We are on TikTok, Linkedin, Elpha, Twitter (if it hasn't imploded yet), Facebook,
                podcasts, etc.. Don't be afraid, reach out! If you are nervous, contact me. Find me
