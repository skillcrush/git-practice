                <h4>Trust the process!</h4>
                <p>Programming works in absolutes: it is or it isn't. Have faith that when you start coding, 
                    it may not look like much now, but in time you will find a way to make it work! Mistakes will happen
                    and tears may be shed yet seeing the results of your labor transform right before your eyes is so rewarding.
                </p>

                <p>Learning a new skill takes lots and lots of repetitive practice. Programming is learning a new language!
                    You have to study and make conversations with fluent speakers --Slack is your best resource-- to fully
                     absorb everything that you're actively learning. Eventually, you will feel more confident, especially
                     when you catch and fix your own mistakes!
                </p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
