                <h4>Practice Helps!</h4>
                <p>There are so many different commands and processes to learn while coding. Keep practicing and you 
                    will get it. The steps will become more memorable.</p>

                <h4>When practice is not helping, look to the resources available to you.</h4>
                <p>
                    Don't be afraid to search tthe internet, or look at the many resources available to you. This isn't cheating, this is being smart.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>
