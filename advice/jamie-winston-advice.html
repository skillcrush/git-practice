                <h4>Be Shaken but Not Stirred!</h4>
                <p>You will face challenges but don't let them make you a quitter. If there is something you don't know it just means that you have more to learn and you are fully capable of doing so!</p>
                <p>When you feel overwhelmed by a challenge do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take a break (go for a walk, stretch, put in that load of laundry, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Start from the beginning and mentally or actively walk through each step again. Cover your bases!</li>
                    <li>Check for those small errors (grammar, punctuation, curly quotes ugghh!, etc.)</li>
                </ol>
 
                <h4>Pause but Don't Stop</h4>
                <p>You're learning A LOT and the best way to retain this information is to practice using it. Stepping away from it for too long can lead to you forgetting information.</p>
                <p>If you need to lessen your pace then go slower but KEEP GOING!</p>
