            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before.
                It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific
                that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have
                engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig
                deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the
                code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of
                the process.</p>
            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to
                train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
                understand what it's doing.</p>

            <h4>The Art of Continuous Motion.</h4>
            <p>Whether or not the steps are being understood or you're the 'right fit' for a career in technology, the
                best thing you can do is keep momentum in any direction and the skills will come.</p>
