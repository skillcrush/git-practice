                <h4>Take A Break Before You Try, Try Again</h4>
                <p>When I'm learning something new, there comes a point where I feel like if I don't take a break,
                  i'm going to start forgetting what I just learned to learn the new stuff. Our brains can only take
                  in so much in a day. <strong>Take a break!</strong> Your brain will actually process and solidify some of that information
                   while you are at rest, or thinking about something else entirely. Even if you didn't totally 'git' it in
                    the moment. </p>

                    <p>Eureka moments totally do happen when you are doing something unrelated to what you have been working
                      so hard on. Give yourself a break and let your subconscious catch up to you! It will help! Lastly, this
                      also helps when you are just totally stumped on a problem, and maybe getting frustrated. Take a break,
                      come back with a fresh brain and your brain might just do you a favor and provide a new perspective!</p>
