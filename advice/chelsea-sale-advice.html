            <h1>Hi, my name is Chelsea and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>Don't stick to one source!</h4>
                <p>When I decided I wanted to learn code, I signed up for Skillcrush. I also signed up for a secondary class, which is much cheaper, 
                    but less interactive. Having more than one teaching style is helpful in learning something new. If you don't understand something
                    in one class, it just might click for you in another!
                </p>

                <p>Go to your library, book store, or thrift store to find supplemental books on coding. Often times, having a text source that you
                    can hold and pages that you can flip through is a helpful resource. Just make sure that the books you get are up-to-date! You can verify
                    this by looking at the publishing date in the first few pages of any book. There are many elements that will be same today as they where
                    back in 1995, but many more will be different.  
                </p>

                <h4>Stick with it!</h4>
                <p>Learning something new is very exciting! If I could make a career out of going to college and learning every day I would. However, it can also be
                    extremely frustrating when you feel as though you're just not getting it. As someone with adult ADHD, it's common for me to zone out, give up, and
                    not want to continue the lessons. Finding some motivation can be difficult, but do what you can to make it work.  One day, we'll have all the
                    information we need to be bad-ass coders!
