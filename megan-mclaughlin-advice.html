        <h1>Hi, my name is Megan and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <h4>Think big picture.</h4>
            <p>It can be scary when you decide to make the leap to another career, especially if you have little to no
                experience. I don't know about you, but when I'm scared to try something new, I'll put it off forever.
            </p>

            <p>I look at my schedule at the start of the week. I get a sense of the workload for my
                job, any upcoming personal appointments/errands, and also a feel for the kind of downtime I would need.
                From there, I would schedule Skillcrush coursework in my windows of free time. Sometimes, it's an hour
                at breakfast. Other days, I'm fitting some Skillcrush in at lunch. If I was feeling up to it, I would
                knock out a
                lesson on a Sunday afternoon. I was still showing up for my committments, I was balancing with downtime,
                and anything in between was dedicated to this coursework. Some weeks are more productive than others,
                but keep making time for yourself through these changes. You
                can do it!
            </p>

            <h4>Review!</h4>
            <p>Try having a dedicated review day. On Fridays, I know that my mind isn't open to a lot of new
                information. I make Fridays my review days. I check in with myself to see what I remember, what I need
                to go over again, and skills that I can strengthen. Having a review day also helps me in two ways: I can
                see how much I've learned which tells me how far I've come and it helps reduce my overwhelm. It can feel
                like a lot when we learn something new and reviewing helps me feel like I'm on solid ground.
            </p>

            <h4>Make it fun!</h4>

            <p>Two things motivate me: iced coffee and music. When I'm preparing for a longer study session, I'll grab a
                fancy iced coffee and find a great playlist. Finding little ways to treat yourself and make studying fun
                can make such a big difference when you're in the throes of a life change. Find your favorite ways to
                treat yourself and incorporate them into your studies.</p>
