                <h4>Small progress is still progress!</h4>
                <p>It can be easy to get discouraged or feel as though you aren't making enough progress. Just remember that even one percent of progress a day is still progress. Don't get discouraged if something is taking more time to understand or if you just aren't having a good learning day. Work through it one step at a time and eventually you will reach the finish line!
                </p>

                <p>Baby steps are better than not walking at all.</p>

                <h4>You are who you hang out with.</h4>
                <p>My mother always said "you are who you hang out with" well let's use that to our advantage. Studdy buddies or friends in the program can keep you accountable and motivated. Join the slack and meet some peers to help you stay on track! 
                </p>

                <p>Don't have any friends in the program? Tell your mom, spouse, or friends outside the program about your goals and how you plan to reach them. People asking about your progress and encouraging you can be just what you need to stay motivated!</p>
